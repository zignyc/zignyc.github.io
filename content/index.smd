This is a page for meetups and events in New York City
focused on the [Zig](https://ziglang.org) programming language.

We maintain a calendar of meetup events on [Luma](https://luma.com/calendar/cal-kG6xrNfIrxXQIZK)
and [Zig Day](https://kristoff.it/blog/zig-day/) events on [zig.day](https://zig.day/usa/new-york/).

The first meetups were organized by [Mike Belousov](https://mikemikeb.com/);
currently [Robbie Lyman](https://robbielyman.com) is organizing.
